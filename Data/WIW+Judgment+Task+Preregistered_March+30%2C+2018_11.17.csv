A man dying in a suburban street is more upsetting than a highway since he was at a less risky area. A drunk driver killing someone on Saturday morning is more upsetting since it occurred during a day where there is more movement and one is drinking and driving as opposed to at night where it is a bit more expected. Also clothing being burned is more upsetting because it means there was a fire which is more dangerous and probably endangered others. The couple dying coming from a shower is more upsetting since they were probably in a happier state as opposed to those coming from church who were probably at peace. So, I chose my answers based on locations and where such incident is more likely expected ",,2,28,1,82fc16d4fc232872,33IZTU6J82P6CA2KY6BLZ553OJIXSV,3HFWPF5AK97S9SXCOFZW35KEFOBS37

For example: you almost expect a high school football player to get a concussion duing a game.. its just not that surprising but the same incident happening at a basketball game is a little out of the norm. Same with the woman being raped after leaving a bar. You're used to hearing that but leaving a coffee shop in the middle of the day ? Thats out of the norm.  The hardest one I guess was the left foot/right foot question.. Doesnt really matter either way for that one in my opinion . Hope that helps. Have a great day.,interesting and thought provoking survey. I enjoyed. Thanks!,2,35,1,e5c2d48cefd5cd3d,3PH3VY7DJMLOOMJ8JT97TFOZ2WCZW9,38O9DZ0A62BY1C3WD2IOJQJURLF26L
