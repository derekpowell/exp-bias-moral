# Item Norming

We created and normed 20 items, each consisting of a pair of events that differed in their prior likelihood. The two events (outcomes) were manipulated so what one would seem more expected than the other. Participants (_N_ = `r nrow(df_wide)`) were asked to choose which event seemed more likely using a 5-point scale (1 = Event 1 seems a lot more likely, 2 = Event 1 seems a little more likely, 3 = Neither event seems more likely, 4 = Event 2 seems a little more likely, 5 = Event 2 seems much more likely). As predicted, for all items the "more expected" outcome was judged to be more likely. Plot below shows mean likelihood rating by item along with approximate 95% confidence intervals.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# standard error function
stderr <- function(x) {
          sqrt(var(x[!is.na(x)]) / length(x[!is.na(x)]))
}


df %>%
  group_by(trial) %>%
  summarize(
    Mean = mean(response),
    UL = mean(response) + 1.96*stderr(response),
    LL = mean(response) - 1.96*stderr(response)
    ) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = reorder(trial, -Mean), y = Mean, ymin = LL, ymax=UL) +
  geom_pointrange() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 3, linetype="dashed") +

  theme_bw()+
  labs(x = "Trial", y="Mean Likelihoods Judgment") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

From among these 20 items we selected 16 items for use in our experiments.

## Discarded items

These items were included in the norming study but were not ultimately selected for the final study. "Heroin" and "theft" showed the weakest effects on likelihood judgments. We decided that the damage to property in "Scratched" was not sufficiently moral in nature. Finally, "brokeninto" was discarded for being too similar to "flattire" which we ultimately decided had more significant moral content.
