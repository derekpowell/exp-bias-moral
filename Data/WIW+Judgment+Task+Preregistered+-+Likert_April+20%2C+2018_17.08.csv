I started to notice a trend that some circumstances seem to have some expectation of risk. Therefore, they may not be perceived as sad. It reminds me of how people say women shouldn't wear skimpy clothes or they are asking for trouble with some of the examples. If someone leaves a bar and gets raped, well was that expected? But, if someone gets their house destroyed in an area not known for tornados, well was that more upsetting somehow? I realized a lot of the time they are very even to me. A loss was suffered or injury or damage. But I must admit, yes sometimes it does add an extra layer of complication. If an officer gets wounded responding to a 911 call that isn't an emergency but instead is vandalism, then that adds a layer to the already risky nature of their jobs.",This was interesting to think about in the study.

In the case of a tornado in Oregon vs. Nebraska, while the damage was the same, the fact that a tornadoes are happening in Oregon is more disturbing because of what such an event suggests about the whether. It's like hearing the national guard rounded up 100 college students who were demonstrating about polluted well water, then murdered them and left their bodies in the streets. If that happened in Honduras and Uganda, it would be equally horrendous because social breakdowns aren't unusual events there; if it happened in the U.S. and Uganda, it would be slightly worse in the U.S. because it's so unusual, and because the U.S. is supposed to be a shining beacon of democracy for the rest of the world.
