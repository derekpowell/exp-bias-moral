A drunk driver killing someone on Saturday morning is more upsetting since it occurred during a day where there is more movement and one is drinking and driving as opposed to at night where it is a bit more expected. Also clothing being burned is more upsetting because it means there was a fire which is more dangerous and probably endangered others. The couple dying coming from a shower is more upsetting since they were probably in a happier state as opposed to those coming from church who were probably at peace.
